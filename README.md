# SDL SHAID Documentation
This documentation provides information for integrating with the Super Helpful Application ID (SHAID) services. SHAID is a group of micro-services that help keep information about SDL enabled applications synchronized across the SmartDeviceLink (SDL) ecosystem.

## Micro-Services
List of micro-services documented in this repository.
  * [Dumpster](https://smartdevicelink.com/en/docs/shaid/master/dumpster/overview/) - A micro-service to store and synchronize data.  It's the virtual equivalent of throwing your data (read: garbage) into the dumpster, but only letting an elite few trash-pick it.
  * [MAIDS](https://smartdevicelink.com/en/docs/shaid/master/maids/overview/) - A micro-service to create and register unique SDL application IDs.  
  * [SUP](https://smartdevicelink.com/en/docs/shaid/master/sup/overview/) - A micro-service to send notifications that can be asynchronous acknowledged.
