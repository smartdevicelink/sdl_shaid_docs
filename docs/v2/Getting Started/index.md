# Getting Started
All SHAID API calls require authentication via a public and secret key pair sent as header values in each request. If you are an SDLC Silver member or higher, you can obtain your SHAID API key pair on the Company Info tab when logged into the SDL Developer Portal.

If you are not a member yet, but are interested in becoming one, please reference the [SDLC official documents](https://smartdevicelink.com/consortium/) for more information.
